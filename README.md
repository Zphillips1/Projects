# Projects

The following is a list of projects that I may be attempting:

Setup a pi-hole (already have a RPI, might buy more)

Setup Wireshark for packet-inspection (will pursue this later, when I have N+/ CCNA)

Setup potential PS / Python scripts for Automation (for AD or simple tasks)

Create a simple file and web server (probably with Wordpress via Linux)

Configure AD with a domain controller, and attach multiple accounts to it (Guest, User, Admin etc)

Create a simple wordpress website (Linux I'd imagine).

Learn Service-Now, since that is a common ticketing system.

Craft phishing email campaigns using KnowBe4's services.

This list is subject to change as I add or remove things.
